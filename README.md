<h2 align="center">Hey there, fellow developer! 👋</h2>

I'm Estefanía (or Stephanie, if it's easier for you). My day-to-day at work consist of building a Sass platform targeted to small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. In the meantime I like to contribute to my team and the community by developing useful tools, and writing high quality tutorials.

- ☕️ I'm currently working on:
  - My personal blog (🤩).
  - A React UI component library for speeding the development of new projects.

- 📚 I'm currently reading the source code of:
  - [Hads](https://github.com/sinedied/hads)
  - [Waka Readme](https://github.com/athul/waka-readme).

- 🌱 I'm currently learning:
  -  Enough React and Gatsby for building my personal blog.
  -  The basics of Github Actions.
  -  Design Systems 101 and Storybook.
  -  Angular Testing with Jasmine and Karma.

- 🪗 Fun fact: Each day I listen to a new Latinamerican folk album. This is [my Last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/niabh) 😊.
