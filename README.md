<h2 align="center">Hey there, fellow developer! 👋</h2>

<!--I'm Estefanía (or Stephanie, if it's easier for you). My day-to-day at work consist of building a Sass platform targeted to small and medium-sized industrial enterprises. In the meantime I like to work on some fun side projects. 

- ☕️ I'm currently working on:
  - My personal blog (🤩).
  - A Mistborn's GraphQL API + a small frontend.

- 🌱 I'm currently learning:
  -  Enough React and Gatsby for building my personal blog.
